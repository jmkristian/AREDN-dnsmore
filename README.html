<h3>AREDN-dnsmore</h3>
<p>Here is software to enhance the DNS service in an AREDN network.
It enables the use of DNS names in zones other than local.mesh,
and DNS records other than type A (IP address).
For example, CNAME records can define aliases for local.mesh names,
and MX records can guide email forwarding.

<p>To implement this, standard DNS servers are connected to the AREDN network.
See <a href="server/README.md">server/README.md</a>
for directions to set up a DNS server on Ubuntu or Debian.
Data are stored into the servers using the RFC 2136 protocol.
See <a href="client/README.md">client/README.md</a> for directions for using nsupdate.

<p>A client package is installed into AREDN nodes,
which causes them to forward queries to the DNS servers.
See <a href="client/README.md">client/README.md</a>
for directions to build and install this package.

The additional DNS servers should *not* define records in the local.mesh zone.
That zone should only be managed by the core AREDN software.
