## Reading

To enable a client to read information from additional DNS servers:

`./build`

... and upload [built](built)/dnsmore_*.ipk to the client's AREDN node,
using the node's 'Setup > Administration' page. Under 'Package
Management > Upload Package', click 'Browse...', select the
.ipk file and click 'Upload'.

That node and all the computers connected to it will be able to
resolve DNS names via the servers listed in data/etc/dnsmore.conf.
(The connected computers were already configured to query the node,
and now the node is configured to forward queries to other servers.)

As usual, you can't upload the .ipk file if the node is an active
tunnel client. To handle this, disable the tunnel client, upload
the .ipk file and then re-enable the tunnel client. Of course,
this means your computer must be connected directly to the node.

## Writing

To publish information via DNS, choose a zone name
and ask the operator of a DNS server to help you publish it.
They'll give you a secret key. Store it in a file in this format:
```
key "yourzone.com" {
  algorithm hmac-md5;
  secret "bINaryCyberCrudD24CvBI==";
};
```
Keep the secret, secret.
Anyone who knows it can modify data in your zone.
Restricting access to the file is recommended.

Use [nsupdate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/nsupdate)
to store information into the DNS server. For example:
```
nsupdate -k your.keyfile
> server dns-1.local.mesh
> zone yourzone.com.
> update add foo.yourzone.com. 300 A 1.2.3.4
> update add foo.yourzone.com. 300 TXT "Hello, world!"
> send
```
After you update information in the server, it will take some time
for clients to see it. The old information is cached, for as long
as the TTL time with which it was stored. Be patient. If you're
experimenting, store experimental data with fairly short TTL's,
so it won't take a long time to correct mistakes.
